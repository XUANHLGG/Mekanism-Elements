# Version 3.0.3

## Recipe Stability & Chemical Fixes

This version focuses on fixing remaining recipe failures for machines and ensuring all chemical processing chains are functional in Minecraft 1.21.

### Changes
- **Machine Recipe Fixes**:
    - **Injecting**: Resolved an issue where `injecting` recipes (Syringes, Concrete Clumps) were failing to load due to a missing `per_tick_usage` field.
    - **Separating**: Fixed strict type errors in Electrolytic Separator recipes (e.g., Potassium Chloride) by correctly using `fluid` instead of `id` for inputs.
    - **Chemical Infusing**: Fixed all 11 recipes (Ammonia, Nitric Oxide, etc.) by converting legacy camelCase keys (`leftInput`, `rightInput`) to 1.21 snake_case and updating IDs to use the `chemical` key.
- **Ammonia Restoration**: Restored Ammonia Rotary Condensentrator recipes by correctly linking Elements Fluid to the appropriate Gas IDs, ensuring visibility in JEI.
- **Folder Cleanup**: Fixed a typo in the resource folder name (`oxdizing` -> `oxidizing`).
- **Beryllium Ingot**: Added the missing smelting and blasting recipes for the Beryllium Ingot (previously unobtainable).

### Performance & Cleanup
- Standardized all machine recipe JSON structures to match Mekanism 1.21.1 requirements.
- Removed legacy test files and unused temporary scripts.
