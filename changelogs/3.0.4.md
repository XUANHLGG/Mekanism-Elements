# 3.0.4

## Fixes
- Fixed a critical `NullPointerException` crash affecting multiple machines (`TileEntityAdsorptionSeparator`, `TileEntityRadiationIrradiator`, `TileEntityAirCompressor`, `TileEntityChemicalDemolitionMachine`, `TileEntitySeawaterPump`) due to unsafe initialization order of Tanks and Energy Containers.
- Improved stability of TileEntity construction to prevent future race conditions.
