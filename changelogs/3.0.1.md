# Version 3.0.1

## Fluid Rendering Fixes

This version fixes critical fluid rendering issues and adds custom textures for seawater.

### Changes
- **Custom Seawater Textures**: Added custom still and flowing textures for seawater fluid
- **Fluid Rendering Fix**: Fixed null sprite issues that caused crashes with Embeddium and missing textures in Mekanism GUIs
- **Client Extensions**: Properly registered client fluid type extensions for all fluids to ensure correct rendering
- **GUI Improvements**: Fixed missing texture tiles in Mekanism GUIs and creative tanks

### Technical Notes
- All fluids now have properly registered client extensions with appropriate textures and tint colors
- Seawater uses custom textures while other fluids use Mekanism's generic tinted liquid sprites
