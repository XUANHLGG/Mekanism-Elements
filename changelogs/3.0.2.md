# Version 3.0.2

## JEI & Recipe Loading Fixes

This version resolves critical issues preventing recipes from appearing in JEI and loading correctly in Minecraft 1.21.

### Changes
- **Fixed Recipe Visibility**: Resolved an issue where standard Mekanism Elements recipes (like High Performance Adsorbents) were not showing in JEI.
- **Fixed Silent Failures**: Corrected the Data Pack folder structure (`recipes` -> `recipe`) which caused many files to be silently ignored by the game.
- **Recipe Format Update**: Fixed 130+ recipe files that used the legacy `"id"` key instead of the strict 1.21 `"item"` key for input ingredients.
- **JEI Crash Fix**: Fixed a `ClassCastException` in the JEI plugin integration.
- **Legacy Key Cleanup**: Removed deprecated keys (`slurry`, `gas`) from recipe outputs in favor of the standard `"id"` field.

### Technical Notes
- Implemented custom `MSJEIRecipeViewerRecipeType` to correctly bridge Mekanism and JEI types.
- Standardized all recipe JSONs to use strict 1.21 codecs.
